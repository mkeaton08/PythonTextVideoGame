# PythonTextVideoGame

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This was my very first programming project. I created a text based video game that allows a user to input commands to move through each room and acquire an item in each room. Users must follow the map that is provided with the game to see the layout of the rooms. Once all 6 items are collected then the user must move to the final room and defeat the final boss.

# What did you do particularly well?
One thing that I did very well in this project was link all the rooms together using a dictionary as well as link the items to each room. This allowed me to store key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An area where I could enhance this code is to add user input validation. Currently in the program if a user enters a direction and there is no room to enter in that direction then the program will end. To enhance this, adding user input validation will tell the user to input another command or choose a different direction rather than terminating the program.
